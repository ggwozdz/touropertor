u will need to set environment variables for facebook auth:
	rhc set-env FACEBOOK_ID=id -a touroperator
	rhc set-env FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret -a touroperator


Your app should now be live at 
	http://touroperator-ggwozdz.rhcloud.com/~/com

You may need to address the issues mentioned above and restart the server for the app to work correctly 
	rhc app-restart -a touroperator
After app modification run
	grunt build
Then deploy with
	grunt buildcontrol:openshift
